        >, also known as noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os, is a simplistic yet
        intriguing game. The goal of the game is to get three of your markers
        (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or
        diagonally, before your opponent does.

        This universally recognized game has roots that can be traced back to
        ancient Egypt, where games with similar mechanics were played on carved
        stone slabs. The Roman Empire also fostered a comparable game known as
        "Terni Lapilli". Although the exact rules of these ancient games aren't
        known, they share common features with modern tic-tac-toe, such as the
        grid-based layout and the concept of lining up symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tic-tac-toe we know today likely emerged in the 19th century. Its
        simplicity and binary outcome made it an ideal candidate for early
        computer games and artificial intelligence studies. In 1952, "OXO" or
        "Noughts and Crosses", one of the first video games, was developed by
        A.S. Douglas as part of his PhD work at the University of Cambridge.

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        The game consists of a 3x3 grid of squares. The game begins with an
        empty grid. There are two players in Tic-Tac-Toe. One player is 'X' and
        the other player is 'O'.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of the game is to place three of
        your markers in a row on the grid. This can be done horizontally,
        vertically, or diagonally.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Player Turns:</strong> Players take turns to place their marker
        (either 'X' or 'O') into an empty square on the grid. The player who is
        'X' goes first.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Winning the Game:</strong> If a player succeeds in placing three
        of their markers in a row, they win the game. Once a player has won, the
        game ends and can be restarted with a new empty grid.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Stalemate:</strong> If all of the spaces on the grid are filled
        and no player has succeeded in placing three of their markers in a row,
        the game is a draw, often referred to as a "stalemate" or "cat's game".
        In this case, the game ends and can be restarted with a new empty grid.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Continuing the Game:</strong> After the game has ended, either
        with a win or a draw, the players can choose to continue playing. It's
        common to keep score, with each win contributing one point to the
        winning player's score.
